					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">In the era of big data, vast amounts of high-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in various domains, such as social media, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Training machine learning algorithms on such high-dimensional data is not practical due to the curse of dimensionality. Furthermore, the high-dimensional data might contain redundant and/or irrelevant features that blur useful information from relevant features. Feature reduction can address the above issues by building a smaller but more informative feature set.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> <b>Feature selection (FS)</b> and <b>feature construction (FC)</b> are two main approaches to feature reduction. FS aims to select a small subset of original (relevant) features. FC aims to create a small set of new high-level (informative) features based on the original feature set. Although both approaches are essential pre-processing steps, they are challenging due to their large search spaces. The search spaces of FS and FC are also rough, where a slight change in the new feature set leads to a substantial change in the learning performance. A variety of heuristic search techniques have been applied to feature reduction, but most of the existing methods still suffer from stagnation in local optima and/or high computational cost. Due to the powerful search abilities and flexible solution encoding/representation schemes, there has been increasing interest in using evolutionary computation (EC) techniques to address feature reduction. EC techniques have now become an essential means for handling high dimensionality issues.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This tutorial firstly introduces the main concepts and the general framework of feature reduction. Then, we will show how EC techniques, such as particle swarm optimisation, genetic programming, ant colony optimisation, and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation, can address challenges in feature reduction. The effectiveness of EC-based feature reduction is illustrated through several applications such as bioinformatics, image analysis and pattern classification, and cybersecurity. The tutorial concludes with existing challenges for future research.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><b>Potential audiences:</b> The tutorial is designed as an introductory tutorial that provides the main concepts and the overall system of evolutionary feature reduction. At the same time, the attendees will also learn the pros/cons of applying different evolutionary algorithms to achieve feature reduction and state-of-the-art evolutionary feature reduction algorithms. Some potential future research directions are also explained in the tutorial. </p>
