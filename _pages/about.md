# About me
I am Bach Nguyen (also known in my publications as Bach Hoai Nguyen). I am currently a Lecturer at the Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), New Zealand. I received my PhD from VUW in November 2018, under supervision of Prof. Bing Xue (IEEE Fellow), A/Prof Peter (Pondy) Andreae, and Prof. Mengjie Zhang (IEEE Fellow).

My research interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, and evolutionary computation. I am particularly interested in applying evolutionary computation to achieve feature mannipuluation, transfer learning, and multi-label learning. My current research topics include:
- Machine learning: Classification, Transfer Learning/Domain Adaptation, Multi-label Learning, and Multi-objective Learning.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Feature Selection, Feature Construction, and Feature Extraction.
- Evolutionary Algorithms: particularly Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO),  Differential Evolution (DE), and Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimisation (EMO).
- AI for Climate Change and Agriculture.
