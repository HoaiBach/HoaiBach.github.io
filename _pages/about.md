# Reserch Interests
My research interests inclide artificial intelligence, machine learning, and evolutionary computation. I am particularly interested in applying evolutionary computation to achieve feature mannipluation and transfer learning. My current research topics include
- Evolutionary algorithms, particularly particle swarm optimisation and differential evolution
- Evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO)
- Feature selection, feature construction, dimensionality reduction
- Classification, transfer learning, domain adaptation
- sucks
