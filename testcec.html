					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">We are now in the era of big data, where vast amounts of high-dimensional data become ubiquitous in a variety of domains, such as social media, healthcare, and cybersecurity. When machine learning algorithms are applied to such high-dimensional data, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where the data becomes very sparse. Furthermore, the high-dimensional data might contain redundant and/or irrelevant features that blur useful information from relevant features. <b>Feature reduction</b> can address the above issues by building a smaller but more informative feature set.</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> <b>Feature selection</b> and <b>feature construction</b> are two main approaches of feature reduction. Feature selection aims to select a small subset of original (relevant) features. Feature construction aims to create a small set of new high-level (informative) features based on the original feature set. Although both approaches are essential data pre-processing steps, they are challenging due to their large search spaces and complex interactions between features. While exhaustive searches are impractical due to their intensive computation cost, traditional heuristic searches require less computational resources but can be trapped at local optima. Recently, evolutionary computation (EC) has been widely applied to achieve feature reduction because of its potential global search ability. Existing EC-based feature reduction approaches successfully reduce the data dimensionality while still improve the classification performance as well as the interpretability of the built models</p>
					<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This tutorial firstly describes a general framework of feature reduction followed by the applications of feature reduction in real-world scenarios. Then, we will show how EC techniques, particularly genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation, differential evolution, genetic programming, ant colony optimisation and evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO) can be applied to address challenges in feature reduction. The effectiveness of EC-based feature reduction is illustrated through several applications including bioinformatics, image analysis and pattern classification, symbolic regression, and cybersecurity. The tutorial concludes with existing challenges for future research.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"><b>Potential audiences:</b>The tutorial is designed as an introductory tutorial that provides the main concepts and the overall system of evolutionary feature reduction. At the same time, the attendees will also learn the pros/cons of applying different evolutionary algorithms to achieve feature reduction and state-of-the-art evolutionary feature reduction algorithms. Some potential future research directions are also explained in the tutorial. </p>
